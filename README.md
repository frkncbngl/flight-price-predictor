# Flight Price Predictor
This project is based on my other projects which lay foundation to the work made here.
- [Web Scraper For Flight Prices](https://github.com/frkncbngl/Flight_data_scraper)
- [Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering](https://github.com/frkncbngl/pandas-data-cleaning)

Based on these projects, I developed a Machine Learning Model using Sklearn's Random Forest Regressor.

Feel free to copy the files and the codes that are shared in this repository to recreate this project on your local computer, or maybe take it even further.

I also have created another model to showcase what the web-app does when you deploy it, due to file size limitations model and the data are small therefore model's timeframe for date prediction is really narrow.

Here is the link where you can try the web-app online: [Flight Price Predictor](https://flight-price-predict.streamlit.app)
